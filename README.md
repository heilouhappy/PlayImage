# PlayImage
This is a project that USES opengl to play images so that it looks like a video.
This project can play a bunch of consecutive pictures, you can put these consecutive pictures in a folder, and use the path to play it, although there is no sound, and when playing some of the lag, I don't know why, but it is very small using OpenGL, it won't consume too much of your memory. If you like it, please add some code to it to make it better. thank you.
